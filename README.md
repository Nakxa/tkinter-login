## Features

- **Custom Theming**: Choose between `light`, `dark`, or `system` appearance modes.

- **Background Image**: A full-screen background image provides a polished look to the application.
- **Login Form**: The login form includes username and password fields with custom placeholder text and modern styling.
- **"Forgot Password?" Link**: Provides an optional "Forgot password?" link for enhanced user experience.
- **New Window on Login**: Upon login, a new window opens without closing the main login window.
- **Custom Buttons**: Modern buttons with hover effects and rounded corners.
